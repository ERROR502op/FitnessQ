## Verifit 
![VeriFit](/metadata/logo/icon.svg?raw=true "VeriFit")

This app is a simple minimalist fitness tracker that I made mainly for myself. The UI is heavily inspired by FitNotes. It's purpose is to replace the traditional paper and pencil method for tracking progressive overload. It's primarily aimed for bodybuilding workout tracking. Since I made this with the primary user in mind being myself, it is not fully featured yet, but I do have future plans for adding extra features over time. It's probably full of bugs and bad code design since I made it from scratch but any suggestions are welcome.

## Features
* Exercise tracking
* Custom exercise option
* Easily import & export in csv format
* Material UI
* Analysis of workout data with visualization
* Tracks Volume, 1RM and other personal records
