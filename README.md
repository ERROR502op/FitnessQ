# FitnessQ
FitnessQ is a simple minimalist fitness tracker that I made mainly for myself. The UI is heavily inspired by FitNotes. It's purpose is to replace the traditional paper and pencil method for tracking progressive overload. Since I made this with the primary user in mind being myself, it is not fully featured yet, but I do have future plans for adding extra features over time. This is my first attempt so suggestions and code improvements are always welcome.
